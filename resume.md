# Summary

My strongest subjects have always been English and Mathematics. Throughout my college years, I have also discovered a newly found passion of mine in Information Systems and Data Science. 

If given the opportunity, I would love to work as a tutor for STEM Tutoring and work with students who have been in my place before when I moved back to the U.S.
